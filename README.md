# TunePalette
A simple web tool to retrieve Spotify user data. This is just a practice project for me so I can get my head around API use and data parsing.

The app is available to use [on my website](https://www.lukeonline.net/projects/tunepalette/). The source is available here for free use, though I have only provided a basic front-end interface.

Let me know of any issues.
